# HRSME---V2
The second part of a book I wrote in my **Creative Writing** course at ITESM. Shoutout to my teacher _Felipe Montes_ for the inspiration

## Families
Each family has different stories, I have jotted down many of them as a way to preserve these tales for future generations

- Rodríguez
- Lacape
- Ongay
- Narváez

The first two families are from my father,  most of its members live in Guatemala. The remaining families are from my mother, the vast majority lives in Mexico
